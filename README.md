# ARKit-Demo

There are so many apps on the Apple App Store that it has become increasingly difficult to develop an app that sets your business apart from others and from your competitors. Today, we don’t need another calendar app or to-do-list app, rather people now expect better AR experiences. And up till now, only a few companies were able to provide them. IKEA for example. IKEA built its AR app with Apple’s ARKit to let their customers preview furniture before making the purchase.
Here, we’ve a created a demo on [How to Make an Augmented Reality App For iPhone and iPad](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/how-to-make-an-augmented-reality-app-iphone-ipad-tutorial/).
